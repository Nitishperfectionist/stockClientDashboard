# Stock Broker Client Web Dashboard

This project is a stock broker client web dashboard that allows users to log in using their email, subscribe to supported stocks, and receive real-time updates on stock prices. The application supports multiple users who can subscribe to different stocks, with their dashboards updating asynchronously.

## Features

1. **User Login**: Allows a user to log in using their email.
2. **Stock Subscription**: Users can subscribe to supported stocks via their stock ticker codes (e.g., GOOG, TSLA, AMZN, META, NVDA).
3. **Real-Time Updates**: The stock prices of subscribed stocks are updated in real-time without refreshing the dashboard.
4. **Multi-User Support**: The app supports multiple users, each subscribing to different stocks, with asynchronous updates on their dashboards.
